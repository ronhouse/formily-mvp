## 2025-07-30

- Agent fixed “Get Started” routing and wired `/upload` page
- File upload now working via FormData + multer
- Image URL returned and previewed successfully
- Order flow now complete up to summary screen
- Mock STL file link generated
- Proceed to Payment triggers backend logic
- Error surfaced due to totalAmount type (expected string, got number)
- Stripe not yet implemented — error is expected for now

## 2025-07-31 – Supabase Integration Victory

- Fixed broken database path: app was writing to Replit’s local PostgreSQL instead of Supabase
- Discovered incorrect environment variable assignment (URL and key were flipped)
- Agent resolved Supabase client initialization and connected environment securely
- Full schema mismatch resolved by dropping and recreating `orders` table in Supabase via SQL
- Table now supports:
  - `image_url`, `model_type`, `engraving_text`
  - `font_style`, `color`, `quality`, `total_amount`
  - `specifications`, `stl_file_url`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `status`, `user_id`
- Successful order submission now inserts real rows into Supabase

Next:
- Stripe webhook wiring
- Order status updates
- Optional: Admin dashboard or fulfillment automations
