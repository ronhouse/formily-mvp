## 2025-07-30

- Agent fixed “Get Started” routing and wired `/upload` page
- File upload now working via FormData + multer
- Image URL returned and previewed successfully
- Order flow now complete up to summary screen
- Mock STL file link generated
- Proceed to Payment triggers backend logic
- Error surfaced due to totalAmount type (expected string, got number)
- Stripe not yet implemented — error is expected for now

## 2025-07-31 – Supabase Integration Victory

- Fixed broken database path: app was writing to Replit’s local PostgreSQL instead of Supabase
- Discovered incorrect environment variable assignment (URL and key were flipped)
- Agent resolved Supabase client initialization and connected environment securely
- Full schema mismatch resolved by dropping and recreating `orders` table in Supabase via SQL
- Table now supports:
  - `image_url`, `model_type`, `engraving_text`
  - `font_style`, `color`, `quality`, `total_amount`
  - `specifications`, `stl_file_url`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `status`, `user_id`
- Successful order submission now inserts real rows into Supabase

Next:
- Stripe webhook wiring
- Order status updates
- Optional: Admin dashboard or fulfillment automations

## August 1 – Stripe Checkout Complete + STL Flow Locked In

- ✅ Integrated Stripe Checkout in test mode (API keys + .env)
- ✅ Created checkout session endpoint with order metadata
- ✅ Wired "Proceed to Payment" button on summary screen
- ✅ Redirected to Stripe and returned to confirmation page post-payment
- ✅ Confirmed Supabase status updates from "pending" to "paid"
- ✅ Mock STL file available on confirmation and order history pages
- ✅ Verified full end-to-end test with successful payment flow
- 🛠️ Noted temporary error on first attempt (invalid return URL), now resolved
- 🔜 Phase 3 kickoff pending (mock webhook to printer service)

## ✅ MVP Phase 3: Payment → Webhook → STL Download Flow (Completed 2025-08-01)

- Integrated Stripe checkout with test card support
- Configured success and cancel URLs using dynamic base URL detection
- Set up Supabase to log and update order status after payment
- Implemented webhook to simulate STL generation after payment confirmation
- Added real-time polling to confirmation screen to show when STL is ready
- Added fallback "Retry STL Generation" button for resilience
- Download button now delivers STL file from Supabase mock URL
- Fully deployed to Replit (autoscale, port fix, static build config corrected)
- Fixed domain issues to eliminate “Hmm... We couldn’t reach this app” error
- Confirmed entire end-to-end flow working in production

Example Order:
- Order ID: FM-057D3ECC
- Status: Ready
- File URL: [Mock STL File]

- Finalized Stripe payment flow: tested with mock card, successful redirect to confirmation
- STL generation wired to confirmation page with dynamic link and download
- Webhook test successful post-deployment
- Replit deployment error resolved with agent help

## [PHASE 4 COMPLETED] – August 2025

### Major Additions
- ✅ `/api/generate-stl/:orderId` endpoint implemented (mock STL gen)
- ✅ `/api/send-to-printer/:orderId` endpoint sends payload to mock print partner
- ✅ STL file URL saved in Supabase + status tracking updated (pending → completed)
- ✅ Admin panel created at `/admin` with table view, action buttons, and password gate
- ✅ Added Regenerate STL, Force Complete, Mark as Failed buttons
- ✅ Auto dispatch toggle (triggers webhook + email after STL gen)
- ✅ Email system integrated using SendGrid API (env key: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`)
- ✅ STL cleanup endpoint created for expired/failed orders (14+ days)
- ✅ UI polish complete (navbar links, scroll bug, preview placeholders)

## [PHASE 5 – STL Pipeline Functional] – August 5th 2025

### Major Updates
- 🔧 Fixed legacy mock logic — payment endpoint now triggers real STL generation via Replicate TripoSR
- 🧠 Confirmed `.glb → .stl` conversion pipeline seamlessly using actual TripoSR outputs
- 🎯 End-to-end test passed with user-uploaded image (Jake) — STL file downloadable and geometry verified

### Known Issues Remaining
- Model scale too small by default
- Unwanted background geometry
- Low detail quality from default model output

# 📦 Formily STL Pipeline — Phase 5 Progress Log

## ✅ Major Wins

- End-to-end image → 3D model STL pipeline fully operational
- Successful image upload, order creation, Replicate API call, `.glb` to `.stl` conversion, and downloadable STL
- First successful download rendered correctly in Bambu Studio (Jake image)

## 🔄 Key Fixes During This Phase

- Replaced broken TripoSR model reference with working Replicate version
- Diagnosed and removed placeholder URLs from order creation
- Fixed mismatch in STL filename generation vs download
- Replaced legacy mock function that marked orders as “ready” before STL generation
- Implemented real Replicate → `.glb` → `.stl` flow
- Added error logging and `error_message` column to Supabase table
- Verified successful order entries and downloads via Replit-hosted links

## 🛠️ Attempted Enhancements

- Installed `rembg` and created a hybrid background removal system using both Replicate and OpenCV
- Verified directory structure: `/uploads/original/`, `/uploads/clean/`
- Observed partial background removal success only when Jake’s image was pre-cleaned with Canva
- Determined `rembg` failures and Replicate background removal model deprecation may be primary issues

✅ Core STL generation loop validated  
⚠️ Background removal unreliable  
⚠️ STL detail and quality inconsistent  
✅ Agent-powered debugging flow working  
📌 Ready to transition to automated external pipeline (n8n)

## 🧭 Next: Phase 5 (n8n-based pipeline)
- Automate and modularize all image → background removal → 3D generation → file hosting in external workflow
- Use n8n to debug and log each stage cleanly
- Enable multi-model experimentation and failure fallback handling
