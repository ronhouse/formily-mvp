# Replit.md

## Overview

**Formily** - A complete 3D printing web application that transforms user photos into custom 3D printable objects. Users can upload photos, choose from keychain/tag/plaque styles, customize with engraving, pay securely via Stripe, and receive downloadable STL files. Features anonymous authentication, order tracking, and a polished multi-step workflow.

**Status**: Fully scaffolded and functional with placeholder API keys. Ready for production deployment once real Supabase and Stripe credentials are provided.

## User Preferences

- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Production start script (npm run start)
- ✅ **Ready for deployment** - All requirements met

### Deployment Configuration Applied (Aug 1, 2025)
1. **Server Configuration**: Updated server to use app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0') format for proper deployment compatibility
2. **Health Check Endpoint**: Added /health endpoint returning server status, uptime, and memory usage  
3. **Production Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging and non-crashing error handling in production
4. **Environment Validation**: Production startup validates required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Added SIGTERM and SIGINT handlers for clean server shutdown
6. **Static File Serving**: Verified build output serves correctly from dist/public/
7. **Production Scripts**: Confirmed npm run build && npm run start workflow functions properly  
8. **Build Output**: Server compiles to dist/server/index.js (34KB) using esbuild bundler
9. **Static File Serving**: Fixed path issue - files copied to dist/server/public/ where server expects them
10. **Port Configuration**: Server listens on 0.0.0.0:5000 with proper host binding for deployment

- ✅ Added protocol detection (https for Replit domains, http for localhost)
- ✅ Enhanced logging for Stripe checkout session creation and URLs
- ✅ Added session_id debugging on confirmation page for troubleshooting
- ✅ Production server correctly serves at 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit deployments
