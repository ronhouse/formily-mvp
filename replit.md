## Overview

**Formily** - A complete 3D printing web application that transforms user photos into custom 3D printable objects. Users can upload photos, choose from keychain/tag/plaque styles, customize with engraving, pay securely via Stripe, and receive downloadable STL files. Features anonymous authentication, order tracking, and a polished multi-step workflow.

**Status**: Fully scaffolded and functional with placeholder API keys. Ready for production deployment once real Supabase and Stripe credentials are provided.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
